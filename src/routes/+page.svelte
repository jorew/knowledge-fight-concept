		We primarily talk a bunch about how Alex Jones is an idiot and intentionally misleads his
		listeners for fun and profit, but that's not the whole story. We also branch off into the nature
		of conservative propaganda and the art of the con, breaking down scam artists from the worlds of
		politics, religion, and of course, outer space.
	</p>
	<p>
		It sounds more complicated than it is; really it's just a show about one friend researching
		things and telling another friend about the depressing and hilarious things he learned.

		Our back catalog can be kind of daunting, and people sometimes donâ€™t know where to start with
		the show. The consensus seems to be that this episode covering January 7, 2011 is a pretty crazy
		episode and possibly a good one to recommend to folks new to the show. Give it a whirl and see
		what you think.
